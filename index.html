  <h1> Conspiracy Theories Throughout Art History</h1>
  <p>There are many conspiracy theories out there. Did we <em>actually</em>
    go to the moon? Do airplanes put chemtrials
    in the sky?
    <strong>Are birds even real?!</strong>
  </p>
  <p>While All of these are exceptional theories, our focus will be on conspiracies surrounding the world of art. </p>

      <h2>The Conspiracies Begin</h2>

      <p> Art has either contributed to, or been the focus of conspiracy theories for centuries. Whether the artist
        themselves were inspired by forbidden topics, inserted clues about their lives, or has been given credit for
        artwork that is not theirs, mysteries abound.</p>

      <h2>The Hidden Numbers of Mona Lisa</h2>
      <p>Many questions are constantly asked about the most famous painting in the world, the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da
        Vinci. Who is the woman? What was da Vinci's purpose in painting her? Why was this painting carried with him for
        years but never finished? These inquiries have been studied for years, and still new theories arise. The latest
        of these comes from a man named Silvano Vinceti. While studying a high definition, blown up photograph of the
        artwork with a magnifying glass, Vinceti claims to have found the number 72 under a bridge
        in the background, the letter "S" in her right eye, and the letter "L" in the left. If true, this discovery
        would then have to be interpreted. Vinceti believes that the "S" stands for the name of the woman being painted,
        the "L" for Leonardo, and the 72 has some sort of religious significance. </p>

    <h2> Music in the Last Supper</h2>
    <p>Da Vinci's The Last Supper has been the focus of many conspiracy theories, including some featured in the popular
      book "The Da Vinci Code". There is a bit of mystery for everyone within the painting. Upon further study, an
      Italian musician named Giovanna Maria Pala made a discovery. If a person marks the location of each roll, whether
      it is on the table or in a hand, a seemingly random pattern of dots appears. However, if you put five lines across
      the painting with the dots, they line up to become a musical composition. When the notes are played, they come
      together to create a requiem, perhaps already mourning the death of Christ.</p>
